## About The Project

This is a simple website I've created due to the fact I have several projects that are located at `https://brennanbrown.github.io`, and it felt like a good idea to give those projects a homepage.

Here's a list of projects that are being hosted here via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/):

- **Stars** - <https://brennanbrown.github.io/stars>: ‚≠ê A collection of repositories that I've starred, using an automatic service by maguowei.
- **Notes** - <https://brennanbrown.github.io/notes>: üìì My notes on technologies and theory within software and web development.
- **Javascript Projects** - <https://brennanbrown.github.io/javascript-projects/>: ‚òï Demonstrating my skills and abilities with vanilla JavaScript.
  - **Sortable Tables** <https://brennanbrown.github.io/javascript-projects/sortable-tables>: A portfolio piece that addresses some of the common interview questions on arrays, sorting algorithms, and optimizing code performance.
  - **Flashcard Game** - <https://brennanbrown.github.io/javascript-projects/flashcards>: Explores some more advanced JavaScript concepts‚Äîincluding how to manage propagation and binding‚Äîwith interactive card games.
  - **Rebound Game** - <https://brennanbrown.github.io/javascript-projects/rebound-game>: Explores game creation with JavaScript as a way of enhancing skills in all areas of development.

## Installation

### Fork the repository

You'll be making your own copy of the "personal website starter" repository so you have your own project to customize. A "fork" is a copy of a repository. So select "Fork" atop [the repository](https://github.com/github/personal-website).

Once you've found a home for your forked repository, it's yours. You're the owner, so you're ready to publish, if you wish.

### Install in your local development environment

If you want to manage your website in a local web development environment, you'll be using [Ruby](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

Once you've found a home for your forked repository, **[clone it](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)**.

#### Install Jekyll

Jekyll is a [Ruby Gem](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/#gems) that can be installed on most systems.

1. Install a full [Ruby development environment](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
2. Install Jekyll and [bundler](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/#bundler) [gems](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/#gems)

```
gem install jekyll bundler
```

3. Change into your new directory

```
cd personal-website
```

4. Install missing gems

```
bundle install
```

5. Build the site and make it available on a local server

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You should see something like:

```
Configuration file: /octocat/personal-website/_config.yml
            Source: /octocat/personal-website
       Destination: /octocat/_site
 Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental
      Generating...
   GitHub Metadata: No GitHub API authentication could be found. Some fields may be missing or have incorrect data.
                    done in 14.729 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/octocat/personal-website'
    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```

Don't worry about the "No GitHub API authentication could be found" message. [API authentication is only necessary](https://github.com/jekyll/github-metadata/blob/master/docs/authentication.md) if you intend to display more detailed metadata, like a branch name.

6. Now browse to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
